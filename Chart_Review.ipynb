        "\n",
        "We can see that during her stay, there were 3 categories of notes written: nursing/progress notes, ECG reports, and a discharge summary. There are other note categories as well, including radiology reports, physician notes, echo, nutrition notes (rare), social work notes (rare), and others. Let's look a little closer at these 3 note categories that are here.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Nursing Notes</h4>\n",
        "\n",
        "Nursing notes often tell the most comprehensive narrative of the patient's care. As is usually the case, the notes tend to be spaced 12 hours apart because that is the length of a nursing shift. Theese notes are how one nurse communicates to his/her successor nurse the current state of the patient. As a result, these notes tend to be one of the most readable parts of the picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another interesting observation to note is that the first note is timestamped 148 hours. That time offset is 148 hours from the patient was admitted to the hospital. As we will see when we dig deeper, this patient arrived to the emergency department and was admitted to a non-ICU ward in the hospital. Because MIMIC is an ICU database, we don't have access to the progress notes written while she was there. Once she transferred to the medical ICU, the MICU nurses began taking notes.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might find the deidentification notation (e.g. \\[\\*\\*Hospital Ward Name \\*\\*\\] or \\[\\*\\*Name (NI) 8830\\*\\*\\]) unintuitive. These symbols indicate that a piece of Protected Health Information (PHI) was originally in the note collected at the Beth Israel. As a condition for them sharing their data to MIMIC, the data was de-identified to be compliant with privacy laws like HIPAA.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>ECG Reports</h4>\n",
        "\n",
        "The ECG report is far less interpertable to non-experts. An electrocardiogram test was ordered to measure something about the patient's heart, and the report was written by a doctor. To be honest, for a variety of reasons, I tend to not use ECG notes very often.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, observe that the time offset is \"n/a\". This is because some note categories (e.g. ECG, echo, discharge summary) do not have their timestamp recorded in the EHR system. Such inconsistencies can make Machine Learning tasks hard. For instance, if we wanted to only use the first 48 hours' data as input, we can't readily tell whether a given ECG report actually was recorded in that timeframe. As a result, these notes are often excluded as a preprocessing step.\n",
        "\n",

        "<h4>Discharge Summary</h4>\n",
        "\n",
        "The discharge summary also does not have a timestamp, but we know that every discharge summary is written at the end of the hospital admission. Note that there is not a summary per ICU stay, so even if a patient transfered from ED -> general ward -> MICU -> general ward -> CICU, they would still only have one discharge summary at the end of their hospital stay.\n",
        "\n",
        "The discharge summary is often the best place to start for trying to understand the care a patient received. Despite the messiness of the layout, there is usually a consistent set of very helpful sections for understanding the patient's path, such as: History of Present Illness (HPI), Hospital Course, Social History, etc.\n"
